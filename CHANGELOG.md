# Changelog

Release notes for ALMS, with an emphasis on **operator-facing changes** — default flips,
configuration and wire-shape changes, and upgrade impact. Implementation detail lives in
the git history.

## v0.2.4 — unreleased (`develop`)

### ⚠️ Default changes — read before upgrading

Each item below changes behaviour for a deployment that has not set the knob explicitly.

- **Agent-loop hard caps now default ON, and the run-duration guard is inactivity-based.**
  `[llm].max_iterations` defaults to `500` and bounds a single run of any type — web chat,
  scheduled job, or subagent. A run is terminated when it stops making *progress* rather
  than on flat wall-clock, so a long but productive run is no longer clipped. New `[llm]`
  knobs: `between_iterations_secs` (default `180`) and `tool_phase_ceiling_secs` (default
  `900`); the absolute backstop `max_run_duration_secs` rose from 4h to 24h.

  **After upgrading**, a previously-unbounded deployment will end any run exceeding 500 LLM
  calls, stalling past a phase budget, or running 24h as `failed`. A stalled run carries its
  own session label, **"Agent stopped after stalling (no activity)"**, so it is
  distinguishable from a crash. Set any knob to `0` to disable that cap. All are
  config-file-only — not mutable via `PATCH /settings`, no env override, restart required.
  See `docs/config.md` § "Agent-loop hard caps".

- **`[llm.anthropic].thinking_budget_tokens` default `0` → `2048`.** Anthropic deployments
  that never set it explicitly start paying ~2048 thinking tokens per turn.

  **To disable it after upgrading**, set the per-agent `thinking_budget_tokens` to `0` (an
  explicit zero disables), or pin `[llm.anthropic].thinking_budget_tokens = 0` fleet-wide.
  ⚠️ `clear_thinking_budget_tokens: true` does **not** disable thinking — it clears the
  per-agent override back to *inherit*, and inheriting now means `2048`, so it re-enables it.

- **`[llm].timeout_secs` `120` → `600`; `[llm].stream_chunk_timeout_secs` `60` → `180`.**
  The first is the per-call HTTP deadline, raised because heavy reasoning models
  legitimately reason past 120s; the second is the per-chunk body-silence guard. Both apply
  to every run type and are inherited verbatim by subagents.

  **After upgrading**, a provider that accepts the connection and then goes quiet hangs for
  up to 10 minutes instead of 2. A host that is simply unreachable is still bounded by a
  fixed 30s connect timeout. Pin lower values under `[llm]` if you prefer tighter deadlines.

- **Default model and provider changed.** `[llm].model` now defaults to `z-ai/glm-5.2` on
  the `openrouter` provider. Conversation summarisation no longer reuses the agent's model:
  `[context].summary_model` / `summary_provider` default to the pair
  `google/gemma-4-31b-it` @ `openrouter`. Deployments with an explicit model set are
  unaffected.

  ⚠️ **If your agents run on a non-OpenRouter provider** — Anthropic direct, for example —
  summarisation now needs a resolvable OpenRouter key (`alms auth set openrouter <key>`) or
  it fails. **To restore the old inherit-the-agent's-model behaviour**, clear *both* fields
  together: `summary_model = ""` and `summary_provider = ""`. Setting only one is rejected
  at boot. The empty string is the explicit-clear sentinel on all three surfaces — TOML,
  `PATCH /settings`, and the persisted `settings.json` — so a clear survives a restart.

- **`workspace_write`'s `mode` now defaults per file: `memories` appends, the other three
  replace.** Previously every file defaulted to `write`, so a call that omitted `mode`
  replaced the whole file — the wrong branch to guess for `memories.md`.

  ⚠️ **This changes what an existing tool call does for every agent already calling it.**
  A `workspace_write` on `memories` with no `mode` now *adds* to the file instead of
  replacing it. `personality`, `goals` and `user` still default to `write`, and an explicit
  `mode` is still honoured everywhere.

- **Workspace prompt content now shares a run-scoped context budget.**
  `personality.md`, `goals.md` and `user.md` remain whole unless the available budget
  requires a head window; `memories.md` keeps its 4000-byte tail window. When a file is
  partial, its prompt marker explains the window, a run warning identifies the file,
  and a `workspace_write` replacement is refused until the agent has seen the whole
  file. The same budget is reused after each tool batch, preserving history space
  without shrinking unchanged workspace views. `workspace_read` returns up to 12000
  bytes, so an oversized file that is only partially injected may still need operator
  editing or append-only changes before a complete rewrite is possible.

- **`fs_read` output caps lowered.** Whole-file reads cap at 256 KiB; passing `offset` or
  `limit` falls back to a 64 KiB output budget. Large reads must paginate.

- **Server-default model and provider are now changeable without a restart.**

### Multi-agent and DM

- Two spellings of one subagent name now resolve to a single subagent, and agent names may
  contain capital letters (resolved case-insensitively).
- An interrupted DM end is recorded rather than left invisible to the agent, and the turn
  after a DM ends can no longer message the peer whose conversation just closed.
- A cancelled or failed DM no longer starts a run on the recipient's session.
- Agent-to-agent tool descriptions now state which relationship each tool creates and no
  longer teach agents to poll.
- Subagent sessions are filed under the agent that ran them, with session-keyed cancel
  controls and a status-only subagent status bar.
- An agent with no `personality.md` is no longer handed the first-time setup interview
  ("Ask the user …") on turns no human started. Peer DM turns, notification runs
  (subagent completions, DM ends) and scheduled job runs now get the agent's normal system
  prompt. On a DM turn the interview arrived in the same prompt as the addendum saying the
  counterparty is not a human, and because the condition is "no `personality.md`" rather
  than "first run", an agent that never finished its interview got it on every such turn.
  Web chat and Telegram still start the interview.

### Persistence and durability

- Transactional, versioned SQLite migrations.
- Silent row loss in the persistence layer is now counted and surfaced, and foreign-key
  fallbacks are no longer silent.
- Durable job recovery and atomic, bounded per-agent run admission.
- Scheduled jobs stay active until the agent's full task completes ("job episodes").
- An LLM-written session summary is no longer saved when the summarizer stopped at
  `summary_max_tokens` (`finish_reason: length`) or looped on a few words. Either one used
  to replace the session's accumulated summary outright (one observed case was the word
  `our` repeated to the 1000-token cap), was then fed back as the base for the next
  summary, and was injected into the agent's other sessions as episodic memory. Now the
  existing summary is kept and the refusal is logged at `WARN` with `finish_reason`,
  `output_len` and `check`, under a message containing `summarizer output rejected`; a
  session with no summary yet gets the heuristic `"input" -> "output"` line instead. The
  `compact` strategy's rolling summary is screened the same way, and a refused one neither
  replaces the summary nor advances past the messages it would have covered. The
  summarizer's `reasoning_content` is no longer used as a summary. A summarizer model that
  answers only in its reasoning channel now logs `summarizer returned empty response` at
  `WARN`, with `has_reasoning` set, and its summaries stop updating: an existing one is
  kept as it is and a new session keeps the heuristic line, until the model answers in
  `content`. Summaries saved before upgrading are not repaired.
- A scheduled job that fires while its agent is mid-run is visible while it waits. Its run
  is created `queued` as soon as the firing is admitted: `GET /runs` lists it (trigger
  `scheduled`), `GET /runs/{id}` reports its `queue_position`, `run_created` carries the
  real `queued_behind` (it was hardcoded `0`) and `run_queue_position` updates follow, and
  the log reads `Job fired -> run <id> queued` with `queued_behind`. Before, the run
  appeared only when the agent got to it, so a wait of a minute or two looked like a
  stalled scheduler. The job's episode now opens with the firing as well: `GET /jobs`
  shows it during the wait, and a second firing during the wait is absorbed into the
  catch-up rather than queued. The episode's clock still starts with its first turn, so
  neither the 4-hour episode deadline nor the missed-tick catch-up counts the wait — a
  tick that passes while the firing waits is covered by the turn that runs after it, and
  does not trigger a second run. `DELETE /jobs` cancels a queued firing; its run ends
  `cancelled`, without starting, once the agent's queue reaches it. A job run still queued
  at a hard stop is marked `failed` (`gateway_restarted`) at the next boot, and the job
  fires again through the boot catch-up.

### Tools and workspace

- A replacing `workspace_write` is refused when it would delete text the agent has not
  been shown; a new `workspace_read` tool is how it gets shown.
- An agent's memories survive a concurrent write to its workspace.
- `read_session` and `read_subagent_session` no longer silently return 20 messages, and
  now report what they omitted.
- A reverted shell `cd` is visible to the agent.
- Tool re-registration no longer logs on the happy path, so `WARN` is worth reading again.
- `user.md` is no longer injected into runs on `episodic:` sessions. The prefix is reserved
  for internal summariser sessions everywhere else (session listing, notifications, source
  labels) but the runtime's user-profile gate predated it and defaulted to injecting. The
  shown-view guard follows the prompt, so on such a run a `workspace_write` on `user` in its
  default (replacing) mode is now refused with `never_shown` instead of replacing a file the
  agent can no longer see — the same rule every other non-user-facing run already has;
  `workspace_read` first, or `mode: "append"`, still works. No production code path
  creates an `episodic:` session today, so this changes what *would* happen, not what does.

### LLM errors

- A failed LLM call is labelled with the provider you configured and no longer claims a
  subagent was involved. The run record's `error` and the live `run_error` SSE message now
  read `LLM error (openrouter 401): …` where they read `Subagent LLM error (openai 401): …`
  before: `Subagent` was wrong on every top-level run (the same error is raised for every
  LLM call), and `openai` was the wire-protocol family — wrong for OpenRouter and every
  other OpenAI-compatible entry. The persisted session marker keeps its status-class labels
  minus that prefix (`LLM request rejected`, `LLM rate limit exceeded`, `LLM server
  error`), and a 401/403 now says which key and where — "LLM authentication error:
  openrouter rejected the API key (HTTP 401). Check the openrouter key in the dashboard
  Settings." A custom `[llm.providers.<name>]` entry is pointed at its own `api_key_env` /
  `api_key` instead, since Settings does not accept its name. The audit log is unchanged in
  shape — it has carried the redacted status-class label since #997, which for a 401/403 is
  now the hint above — and only sees this at all when the failing call was a subagent's,
  since audit rows are tool-scoped. The provider's response body is still never persisted.
  Grep queries on `Subagent LLM` need updating; the `AlmsError` variant is renamed
  `SubagentLlmError` → `LlmApiError`.

### CLI

- `alms dashboard` checks that the gateway answers `/health` before opening a browser.
  When nothing is listening it now reports the reason and points at `alms gateway`, and
  **exits non-zero**, instead of opening a browser onto a connection-refused page.
- `alms auth set` / `alms auth remove` apply to a gateway that is already running. Both
  probe `/health` at `--url` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, `ALMS_GATEWAY_URL`) and,
  when a gateway answers, send the change to `PUT`/`DELETE /auth/keys` instead of writing
  `.alms/secrets.json` — the daemon persists it to its own secrets file, so nothing is
  lost on restart, and the key takes effect on the next run. Previously the file was written and
  the running daemon never saw it, because the secrets store is read once at boot: the
  key was visibly on disk and the next run still failed to authenticate. With no gateway
  answering, both commands write the file exactly as before. A gateway that answers and
  then *rejects* the change (a missing `ALMS_AUTH_TOKEN`, say) is now an error rather
  than a silent fall back to the file. `--json` output gains a `target` field
  (`"gateway"` or `"secrets_file"`); `alms auth list` is unchanged and still reads the
  file.

### Frontend

- Normalized entity state for messages, jobs, and runs, with authoritative reconnect
  recovery and optimistic UI actions.
- Revision-aware run and job lifecycles.
- History-reconstructed tool rows correlate with the live event stream again.
- A DM reasoning collapsible is no longer labelled with whichever agent the sidebar
  happens to be showing.
- The sidebar active-run indicator lights on cross-agent sessions.
- First run now offers to store a provider key before the first agent is created, so a
  fresh install no longer starts with a failed run. The step is skipped when a key is
  already in the secrets store, and skippable when it is not: a key wired into `alms.toml`
  via `[llm.providers.<name>].api_key_env` works but is invisible to `GET /auth/keys`, so
  the step is never a gate. Keys set here apply to the running gateway immediately.

### Internal

Entries here exist only where an internal change could be mistaken for an operator-facing
one.

- Seven provably-unreachable `pub` items removed from the library crates — among them the
  `ShellExecTool` type alias (the `shell_exec` wire name is unaffected and still
  registered), a superseded string-based output truncator, and two `RunEventStream`
  constructors that could build an SSE response without subscriber bookkeeping. No
  behaviour change.
- The summary provider/model pair rule ("both or neither") is now one function,
  `alms_core::config::check_summary_pair`, applied by TOML load, `PATCH /settings`, the
  agent CRUD endpoints and the CLI. Error codes are unchanged; the CLI and boot-time
  messages now lead with the code and use the same sentence as the HTTP surface. The
  empty-means-unset normalisation is likewise one function, so three inputs fell into line:
  a `[context].summary_*` value with surrounding whitespace in `alms.toml` or in a
  hand-edited `settings.json` is now trimmed (both used to keep it verbatim, as a provider
  key that could never resolve — and the `settings.json` overlay is applied after config
  validation, so nothing else would have caught it), and `alms agent create
  --summary-provider`/`--summary-model` trim their values as `agent config` already
  did. The retention sweep for `shell_output/` and `tool-output/` spill files is
  likewise one routine, `alms_sandbox::retention::sweep_expired_under`; on-disk
  layout and behaviour are unchanged.
- Three log lines gained structured fields so tests assert on fields rather than rendered
  text: the tool registry's `debug!` now says `Registering tool` with `tool=<name>` (was
  `Registering tool: <name>`), and the worktree drift warnings carry
  `drift=already_present` / `drift=already_absent`. Levels, targets and the rest of the
  fields are unchanged.
- `rustls` 0.23.36 -> 0.23.45 (with `rustls-webpki` 0.103.13 -> 0.103.15) to clear
  RUSTSEC-2026-0285, a TLS 1.3 handshake bug. v0.2.3 carries the affected version, but no
  ALMS connection goes through rustls: `reqwest` is declared with `rustls-tls` *and* its own
  defaults, and reqwest selects the platform backend whenever `default-tls` is on and
  `http3` is off — OpenSSL on Linux, Security.framework on macOS, SChannel on Windows —
  while nothing in `crates/` calls `use_rustls_tls`. So this clears the audit gate on code
  that ships but is never reached; no operator action. Lockfile-only. The same re-resolve
  also moved the Windows-only `windows-sys` dependency of `errno`, `rustix`, `tempfile` and
  `winapi-util` from 0.52.0 to 0.60.2; nothing changes on Linux or macOS, and x86_64
  Windows builds drop `windows-sys` 0.52.0 (aarch64 Windows keeps it for `ring`).

## v0.2.3 — released (tag `v0.2.3`)

Stable on `main`, with Linux x86_64 and Windows x86_64 binaries. Headline changes:

- Workspace v2 single-sandbox-root model — one project-root sandbox, flat
  `.alms/agents/<name>/` metadata, per-agent git worktree mode, and an operator
  full-OS-access escape hatch.
- Anthropic no-args tool fix.
- Structured `MISSING_MODEL_AFTER_PROVIDER_SWITCH` 400 response.
- Per-tool structured output renderers.
- Per-run config override path removed — agents are the single per-tenant config surface.
