    /// > 4000 bytes — so under an append default the file grew at the tail
    /// > while the read window stayed put: a duplicate landed in the cut part
    /// > and was never seen again, `mode: "write"` could not repair it because
    /// > the model held only the head and resending that was itself a
    /// > destructive truncation, and newly appended memories stopped being
    /// > injected at all. #1308 anchors the window to the **tail**, so the
    /// > duplicate an omitted `mode` produces is in the injected end and the
    /// > repair reaches it. The window is still a window: it carries a leading
    /// > marker saying so, and saying that rewriting it with `mode: "write"`
    /// > deletes what it omits, because that is the one thing the model cannot
    /// > work out from the text it was handed.
    ///
    /// The tool's parameter description tells the model both halves of the
    /// trade, and the result echoes the effective mode, so a model that
    /// guessed wrong can find out in the same turn.
    ///
    /// **The explicit branch is no longer unguarded (#1310).** This function
    /// only chooses what an *omitted* `mode` means; an explicit

    /// seen nothing at all; and a file that moved between the last prompt

    /// The two remain independent and both are needed. The guard is not a

/// size limit into a correctness bug: newly written memories are never
/// injected again, and the oldest entries become permanent regardless of
/// whether they are still true. For a file that only ever grows at the end,
/// the old end is the right one to lose.
///
/// **Why the marker leads, and says what it says.** This injection is the
/// view of its memories the agent gets whether it asked or not, and #1305's
/// documented repair for an accidental duplicate is an explicit
/// `mode: "write"` — composed, in the moment, from the text in the system
/// prompt. An unmarked window therefore makes the repair destructive: the
/// agent rewrites the file from a fragment and deletes everything the
/// fragment omits. Tail-anchoring alone does not fix that — it only changes
/// which half is deleted. So the marker goes *first*, because a truncation
/// that removed the start has to be announced before the content rather than
/// after it, and it states the consequence rather than only the size.
///
/// Since #1310 the marker is no longer the only thing standing between the
/// model and that deletion: a `mode: "write"` built on a windowed view is
/// refused outright by [`AgentWorkspace::write_file_checked`], and
/// `workspace_read` gives the agent the whole file when it means to rewrite
/// one. The marker still earns its place — it is what lets a model avoid the
/// refusal instead of discovering it — but it is now the polite half of a
/// guarantee rather than the whole of it.
///
/// **A partial leading line is dropped — only when there is one.** A
/// head-anchored window could only ever end mid-entry, which reads as obviously
/// cut off. A tail-anchored one begins mid-entry, and half a memory read from
/// its middle is not a fragment but a different claim — "- Never delete the
/// staging bucket" cut after "Never " asserts the opposite of the entry it came
/// from. So the window is advanced to the next line boundary, but **only when
/// its start did not already land just after a newline**. An aligned window
/// already opens on a whole entry, and cutting there deletes a complete memory
/// for nothing; with the guard the cut costs at most one entry that was already
/// half gone, and without it that claim is simply false for the aligned input.
///
/// One declared exception, so the property is not read as universal: the cut is
/// skipped when nothing follows the first newline, so a file that is one
/// enormous unbroken line still yields its tail instead of leaving a marker and
/// nothing else. That case does ship a fragment — a fragment that announces
